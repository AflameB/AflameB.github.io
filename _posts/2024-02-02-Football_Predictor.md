# Project Overview: Navigating the Future of Football

This capstone project focuses on the pinnacle of competitive football: the **English Premier League**. The goal was to move beyond simple intuition and use data science to navigate the myriad of interconnected variables that determine match outcomes.

### The Challenge (Situation & Task)
Predicting football results is notoriously difficult due to the dynamic nature of the sport. My task was to manage and analyze extensive data across four seasons (2019–2023) to create a model capable of providing actionable insights for stakeholders ranging from club coaches to betting agencies.

### The Data Science Solution (Action)
I built a comprehensive data pipeline that transformed raw match statistics from [Football-Data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php) into a predictive engine.

* **Data Integration:** Merged four years of Premier League season data into a unified `game_df.csv`.
* **Modeling Approach:** * Used **Classification models** to predict categorical outcomes (Win/Loss/Draw).
    * Implemented **Regression models** for numerical scoreline forecasting.
    * Applied **Time-series analysis** to account for team "form" and temporal momentum.
* **Feature Engineering:** Engineered specific metrics to account for the evolving nature of the 2023/2024 season in real-time.

### Results & Impact (Result)
* **Strategic Value:** Created a model that assists coaches in tactical planning and time-saving.
* **Economic Potential:** Identified opportunities for refined risk management in the sports betting industry, which reaches billions in revenue.
* **Accuracy:** Developed a baseline and complex model strategy that evolves with the ongoing season to maintain predictive precision.
